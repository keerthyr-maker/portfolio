## Skills Demonstrated:

1. Python Data Cleaning(Pandas)
2. Python Data Visualization (Plotly)
3. Data Collection
4. Scientific Communication

## Background: 

I worked on this project as a part of the Emory Data Science Club's project teams, in which we examined water and sanitation access in refugee vs non refugee communities in sub-saharan African countries.

My contribution involved examining sanitation access in Tanzania, comparing two refugee communities to urban regions. Additionally, I explored trends in water access/water hygiene, which was not included in the final deliverable my team presented at symposia.

## Analysis Steps:
In order to analyze the data, I performed the following steps:

1. Data Collection: I collected data on sanitation and water access from data provided by a CDC employee we collaborated with. The data is from two refugee communities and Tanzania overall. 

2. Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data by handling missing values and standardizing the format.

3. Data Exploration: I explored the data by creating visualizations, and identifying any patterns or trends.

4. Results Interpretation: I interpreted the results of the analysis and drew conclusions based on the findings.

## Visuals:

Sanitation Access:

- This bar chart highlights the presence of hand soap in households across refugee and urban communities in Tanzania.
- Urban households demonstrated 10-20% higher soap availability compared to refugee households, suggesting better overall hygiene access in urban areas.

Water Access:

- This visualization showcases primary sources of non-drinking water in Tanzanian urban areas
- Approximately 25% of urban area households rely on alternative water sources, which dominate as the most commonly used non-public options.


![](HandWashMethods.png)
- This visual shows whether people in refugee communities wash their hands more by dipping them into a bowl of water, or by using running water, which is the less sanitary way. 
- Around 20% more individuals prefer the cleaner method of dipping hands into water

## Overall Conclusions:
- Urban households in northern Tanzania report 10-20% greater availability of hand soap compared to refugee communities, demonstrating a gap in hygiene resource access.

- Urban households predominantly rely on non-public water sources for non-drinking purposes. Our next steps would be to identify these alternative sources and evaluate their quality.

- Refugee communities demonstrate hygienic handwashing behaviors, with a slight preference for dipping hands into water, a cleaner method compared to using running water in this context.
