Hello! My name is Keerthy Rangan, a third-year student at Emory University majoring in Quantitative Sciences with a Biology concentration.

## About this Website
This website showcases a selection of personal and academic projects Iâ€™ve developed during my time in college. These projects demonstrate my skills in data science and bioinformatics, providing a glimpse into my work and capabilities.

## My Career Interests/Goals
I am passionate about pursuing a career in bioinformatics or data science after graduation, and aspire to attend graduate school in computational biology or translational medicine.

Throughout my time at college, I have developed strong skills in data analytics, including data wrangling, querying, web scraping, visualization, and dashboard creation.

I primarily work with **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**, and dedicated much of my second year to refining these technical skills.

In addition, I have extensive research experience in biotechnology and cancer biology, having presented findings at symposia. I have also developed essential laboratory techniques such as recombinant plasmid creation and cell culturing. These experiences have deepened my understanding and appreciation for how innovative therapies are developed in medicine.

My overall aim in my career going forward is to contribute to medicine by utilizing data-driven approaches that not only could be useful when developing therapies in a biological research setting, but also can address complex questions in biology.
