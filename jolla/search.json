Overall, synaptic maturation can lead to the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides in the brain, which in turn can contribute to Alzheimer’s pathology.\nMy primary goal with examining APLP1 specifically was to see if its 3D structure has any functional sites that can contribute to its role in synaptic maturation."

However, I noticed there were two specific areas which had more accumulations. One of these areas primarily had alpha helices dimers, while another one had a mix of alpha helices and beta pleated sheets."

It is also primarily involved in cell-cell interactions.\nAlthough there were no active sites that allowed ligand binding, the E1 domain had several disulfide bridges, which helps stabilize the protein structure.\nIn order to find the functional sites that ProSite did not scan for, I used a molecular visualization tool called PyMol. PyMol could also potentially tell us why there were disulfide bridges in the E1 domain instead of the E2."

ACT stands for acetate ion, and is a key ligand for cell adhesion receptors to bind to, which can create an interaction between different cells.\n\nE1 Domain with GOL Functional Site\nThis second visual shows the functional site, GOL, on the E1 domain. GOL stands for glycerol, and its primary function is to provide structural stability, which will help maintain E1’s rigid conformation."
